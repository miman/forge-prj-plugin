This file contains the changes needed for a project to be a forge project.

- Add folder template-files to src/main/resources
- Add file forge.xml to META-INF folder (if we are to use a dependecy jar that works with forge plugins & artifacts.)
- Use the pom.xml velocity template file

Creating example files:
Here we create a Plugin & a Facet file to demonstrate how these are built.

MainPlugin
This has 2 Forge commands
- setup, which uses a normal facet to add an extra file
- extra-cmd, which uses a miman facet to modify the pom.xml file add a Java class
